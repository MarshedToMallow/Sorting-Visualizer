Should work with any value 2+
ELEMENTS: int = 1024

Should work with any values 1+ but I wouldn't recommend anything below around 100, 100
WINDOW_SIZE: tuple[int] = 1200, 800

Normal RGB color from 0 to 255
FILL_COLOR: tuple[int] = 0, 0, 0

0.0 to 1.0
CANVAS_WIDTH: tuple[float] = 0.1, 0.9
CANVAS_HEIGHT: tuple[float] = 0.2, 0.95

The specific type of sort used
SORT: sort = quick

Target FPS, -1 seems to disable the limit
SPEED: int = -1
